# The swift-git example app

A simple reimplementation of parts of the `git(1)` command using [swift-git][].

This repository is intended as a learning resource for swift-git and the
underlying [libgit2][] C API. It's also set up to make it easy to work directly
on swift-git, in order to improve its API and move it closer to parity with
libgit2.

Contributions are welcome!
